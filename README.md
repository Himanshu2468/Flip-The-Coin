# Flip-The-Coin
In this android application/game, I write some Kotlin code in which I take user input as the basis on instructions that is user has to give the input as integer number in which I convert the xml textview into integer to compare the random number as I denote the 1 as head and 2 as tail and 3 as draw.If the user input and the coin has same then You win otherwise you lose. I uses very basics of android development to develop this aaplication.
